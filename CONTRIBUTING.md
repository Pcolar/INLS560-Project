## Getting Involved

There are a number of ways to contribute to OCR-Parser.  Feel free to take a look at our current issues list to see if any of those may interest you.  They are ranked from easy to difficult according to perceived level of difficulty.  You can also use .txt files to test the code and to report bugs or ways to better the code.  This program is meant to make the process of creating metadata for digitized newspaper easier, so we welcome help from all communities to make this program better for the people who use it.


## Getting Started

If you want to help with this project, the first thing to do would be to fork it.  By forking the program, you can work on your own clone of the project and modify it how you see fit.  Once you've hit upon a solution to an issue or have done something to make the code better and more productive then open an issue request.  If it is in response to an issue, reference the issue number in the pull request by using #issue number (such as #3, #4, etc.).  This will allow the committers of the site to have a link to the issue from your pull request.  If it is not in response to an issue and is introducing changes to the code, please be descriptive in your commit message.  And, please test your code before submitting a pull request.  Either use your own files or you can download .txt files from [Chronicling America](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/).

## How To

1.  Fork repository
2.  Response to issue or add/change code
3.  Test code
