OCR-Parser
===============

##Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a program that will allow librarians/information professionals to simplify their workflow by automating certain aspects of the metadata extraction process.  This program is meant mainly for digitized newspapers, and the testing is being done on papers for the North Carolina Digital Heritage Center.

Our goal with this project to automate certain aspects of the digitization workflow, mainly those involving metadata, to allow more time uploading newspapers and less time inputting and correcting standard metadata.

##Usage

All code and instructions will be available from this github repository.  

Full documentation will be up sometime in December.

##Contributing

Once the intital project is realized, we'd love to have contributors help continue to automate the workflow.  Other automatoin steps can include automatically OCRing the text as well as pulling more metadata from the files.
