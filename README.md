##Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a program that will allow librarians/information professionals to simplify their workflow by automating certain aspects of the metadata extraction process.  This program is meant mainly for digitized newspapers, and the testing is being done on papers for the North Carolina Digital Heritage Center.

Outsourcing page level digitization is a cost effective strategy, but results in missing or error prone metadata for the images returned from the vendor.
The current solution at our institution is:
* Create a template spreadsheet
* Copy and fill revelant series or reel metadata
* Open each image and manually extract metadata
* Manually enter the data into the spreadsheet 

This process is expensive, time consuming, and error prone.

This project makes some inroads towards automating the metadata harvesting process.
It's a bit rough around the edges, but open to improvement as a community effort.
