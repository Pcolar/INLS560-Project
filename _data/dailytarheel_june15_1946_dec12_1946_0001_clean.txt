day, June 19, through the following Monday, June 24, and is

headed up by Mrs. Russell M.
Godfrey as co-chairmen.

A hcuse—to-house canvass will be

the Chapel Hill-Carrboro Merchants

Guy B. Phillips and \Villiam H. Po-
teat for the University administration,
faculty and students; Hubert‘ Robert-
son for the Negro citizens, and Walter

the purchase of food for people who
need it desperately in order to sur-
vive,” Mayor Madry said,

Final Plans

Final plafs for the collection will
be made at a meeting of division cap-
tains and co-workers at a meeting in

Nine Z/housumd Veterans Desiring. 7Z"o./Enter
Zlfniocrsity This /Fez/Z/Z Al/Zrcudy

Nine thousand veterans, 5,000 of
them from this State, who want to en-
ter the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill this fall have been told
“there is no room” for them.

At State College in Raleigh more
than 3500 veterans are being denied
admission for the fall term for the
same reason, and rooms cannot be
found for hundreds of applicants for
entrance to the Woman's College at
Greensboro.

Such was the report made to Gover-
nor R. Gregg Cherry and to the Trus-
tees of the consolidated University of
North Carolina at their meeting here
this week by Controller W. D. Car-
michael, J r.

The report also asserted that all
three institutions are in grave danger
of losing many of their professors be-
cause of the salary scale and compe-
tition with other institutions “that

have strained loyalties to the break-
ing point.”

Several surveys indicate that the
peak of the veteran enrolment will
come in 1949 or 1950 and by that time
30,000 veterans and 20,000 other civil-
ians will be denied admission to North
Carolina colleges and universities ‘un-
less the federal government quickly
gives substantial aid toward a college
building program for our private and
public institutions alike”, Controller
Carmichael’s report said.

Senator Meade of New York, it was
pointed out, has introduced a bill in the
Senate which would provide $250,000,-
000‘for grants to colleges, on a 50-50

_basis, for the construction of per-

manent dromitories, classrooms, lab-
oratories and other facilities necessary
for the education of veterans. “This
would be a start”, Controller Car-
michael said.

“The Federal Governmeiit provided

Turned Alwozy

the necessary funds to educate civili-
ans into eﬁicient ﬁghting men. It is
just as logical for the Federal Govern-
ment to provide the necessary funds to
re-educate these ﬁghting men into
healthy, happy, eﬁective citizens. It is
morally sound. It is economically
sound. It will cost a great deal of
money to do it. But not to do it, may
cost a great deal more than money.
“Every veteran on the three cam-
puses of the consolidated University
is costing the State of North Carolina
$200-$250 a .year, despite the vast
amounts of money that are being con-
tributed by the Federal Govemment.”
Controller Carmichael pointed out
that in 1941, the peak year for college
enrolments in North Carolina, “there
were 31,500 students in our institutions
of higher learning: 26,500 were whites
and 5,000 were Negroes. Approximate-
ly 52 percent of the 31,500 were men

and 48 precent were women.

<3‘ The NROTC will continue to offer

course_s in naval science and tactics
during the summer, Captain Donald
W’. Loomis announced, with approxi-
mately 20 students taking courses to
receive a degree and commission in
the Naval Reserve.

Beginning next September, he said,
the NROTC will offer courses under
either the “Holloway Plan” which is
now before Congress or under the
former peacetime NROTC regula-
tions.

The Holloway Plan

Recommendations made by the H01-
loway Board, which were favorably
reported out of the House Naval Af-
fairs Committee, are now before Con-
gress. If the plan wins. Congressional
approval, students will be selected for
the NROTC program by a competi-
tive examination given throughout
the country. Those appointed under
the program will receive all tuition
and fees plus $50 per month during‘
their four years’ college training, but
they must arrange for entrance into
the college of their choice and room
accommodations after their arrival.

Those who successfully complete
the required naval science subjects,
Captain Loomis said, as well as those
subjects for a baccalaureate degree,
will receive a commission. They are
obliged to serve 15 months’ active
duty with the ﬂeet after which time
theygmay return to civilian life with
a reserve commission or they may
apply for a commission in the regular
Navy.

Students under either the Holloway
Plan or the peacetime program in ef-
fect before the war would be under
Navy control only during attendance
at naval classes and drills and would
not be required to wear uniforms ex-
cept during drill periods.

All Marines Leave

Captain Robert E. Brown, in charge
of the Marines, said that 25 men in
this unit will be sent to various bases
for commissioning as lieutenants. The
remaining 50 will be discharged at
Camp Lejeune the middle of June. Al-
most’ 7100 members of the corps have
received training here.

Captain Brown, third commanding
officer which the unit has had since
its formation here, is to be trans-
ferred to San Diego, Calif., where he
will attend sea school for two months,
after which he will be given sea duty.
His family is living in Oberlin, Ohio.

Other leaders of the Mari_i_i_e Corps
group here have been Major James
Marshall, who opened the unit, and
Captain Preston S. Marchant.

Local Group Proposes
War Memorial Fund

The Chapel Hill Chapter of Ameri-
cans United for World Organization
has offered to sponser the establish-
ment of a war memorial fund to be
used to bring to Chapel Hill each year
a distinguished lecturer on some phase
of continuing problems of world or-
ganization and lasting peace.

The Chapter, represented by Dr. J .
B. Bullitt, Preston C. Farrar, and Mrs.
Russell M. Grumman, in an open let-
ter in the Chapel Hill Weekly re-
cently asked for suggestions for an
appropriate way to “honor the young
men of this community who gave their
lives that civilization might live and
that the world might be free from the
greatest danger that has threatened
it in a thousand years.”

There were many suggestions for a
memorial fund for a lecture each year
by a distinguished speaker.

“It is the intention of the Commit-
tee that the Honor Roll of the men
from the Chapel Hill community who
fell in the war be printed on the pro-
gram of each lecture,” it was ex.
plained.

Contributions are being mailed to
Dr. Bullitt.
